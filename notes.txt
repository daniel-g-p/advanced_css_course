GIT REPOSITORY SETUP
    1. Type "git init" in command line to initiate a repository
    2. Type "git branch -m [name]" to set the repository name (optional)
    3. Type "git add ." to stage the initial commit
    4. Type "git commit -m [message]" to finalize the initial commit
    5. Create a remote repository on GitHub
    6. Use instructions to push the local repository to GitHub

BACKGROUNDS
    - Set two values for the background property to create an overlay effect
    - The first specified value will be on top

COLORS
    - Add a number between 00 and 99 to the end of a HEX color to customized its opacity

CLIP PATH
    - Specify the individual coordinates of the corner points separated by commas

CSS ANIMATIONS
    - Keyframes specify states in % (e.g. 50% => 50% of the animation complete)
    - Syntax: "animation: duration function delay count direction fill-mode play-state name 
    - "backface-visibility: hidden" removes bugs in animations and transitions
    - "animation-fill-mode" sets the styling of animated elements before and after the execution of an animation

VS CODE TOOLS
    - Highlighting a bit of code and clicking "CTRL + D" will select the next matching element in the code

CASCADE
    - Author vs User vs Browser Styles may conflict
    - 1. User !important declarations
    - 2. Author !important declarations
    - 3. Author declarations
    - 4. User declarations
    - 5. Browser declarations

UNITS
    - Use "px" over other units where possible as it reduces the computatuions that the browser has to do
    - Percentages of elements are always relative to the parent's width
    - Some properties are inherited while others aren't
    - Inheritance is based on the computed value, not the specified one
    - Root font size should be set in %

BOX-SIZING
    - Best set to inherit on the universal selector and then specified in the body element

BEM MODEL
    - CSS Class naming convention
    - Syntax: block__element--modifier

SASS
    - Mixins are reusable pieces of code that can take and output variables
    - Functions are reusable calculation tools that can use variables to compute them and output them following a formula
    - Mixins copy the code to the selector, Extends copy the selector to the code
    - @use brings files into a folder, @forward brings them in to send them back out
